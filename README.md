This is the first DSPS student competition on the application of AI for pavement monitoring. The competition will follow a data-centric model instead of the traditional model-centric approaches. The data will be derived 

Participants will systematically changing/enhancing the datasets provided using various data cleaning, annotation, augmentation strategies to improve the accuracy of a predefined model architecture.
 

Building on its success at NeurIPS 2019, the Traffic4cast competition is going into its second year offering new challenges and opportunities. 

This yearâ€™s dataset will be derived from an order of magnitude more data. We are collecting data from 10 cities of different size, geography, culture, and economy. The core challenge will be to predict short-term large-scale traffic states in all the cities. Participants can investigate differences and similarities in traffic patterns between the cities, and explore master models trained on multiple cities. 

The dataset will be augmented by new static and dynamic features, such as street maps properties, points of interest, weather, air pollution, and special events. The bonus challenges invite participants to explore the effects of these additional features.
