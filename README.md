## Data Science for Pavements Symposium (DSPS)

This is the first DSPS student competition on the application of AI for pavement condition monitoring. The competition will follow a data-centric model instead of the traditional model-centric approaches. Top-down views of pavement image data containing 5 main distress types annotated with bounding boxes and polygons will be provided. This repo also contains the test data that will be used for ranking submissions. 
<br />
<br />
Participants will systematically change/enhance datasets provided using various data cleaning, annotation, augmentation strategies to improve the accuracy of a predefined model architecture.

## AWARDS
Prices will be offered to the top 3 rankers after the successful presentation of their paper at the conference.
##### First price winner: 
##### Second price winner:
##### Third price winner: 

## RULES
We expect you to respect the spirit of the competition and do not cheat.
* There is no restriction on the size of the team.
* The use of external data is forbidden
* Pre-trained models other than the ones provided are not allowed in the competition
* Teams must only use the algorithm/model selected by the organizers. 
* Please submit source code and trained model before the deadline. IPython Notebook is desirable for the source code submission. The organizers will verify the reproducibility of the algorithm before determining the final winner.
