# Data Science for Pavements Symposium (DSPS)
Building on its success at NeurIPS 2019, the Traffic4cast competition is going into its second year offering new challenges and opportunities. This yearâ€™s dataset will be derived from an order of magnitude more data. We are collecting data from 10 cities of different size, geography, culture, and economy. The core challenge will be to predict short-term large-scale traffic states in all the cities. Participants can investigate differences and similarities in traffic patterns between the cities, and explore master models trained on multiple cities. The dataset will be augmented by new static and dynamic features, such as street maps properties, points of interest, weather, air pollution, and special events. The bonus challenges invite participants to explore the effects of these additional features.
